TEST ALL FUNCTIONALITY FOR CURRENTLY WRITTEN STUFF

Write DatafilesP

Add a chaching mechanism for tags in TagP.py
    There should be a read/write buffer. new tag edits should be cached until they can
    be written.
    This will probably require a function to add a list of urns to a tag

    You can either add/remove a list of URN's to a single tag or
    add/remove a singel URN to a list of tags. Can I combine both into a single
    efficient process?




implement close methods for all of the processes
